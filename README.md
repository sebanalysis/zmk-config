Configuration for my handbuilt mechanical keyboard

TODO: 

- ~~change numpad . to normal .~~
- ~~make the underscore to the plus key and move zoom to a special key combo with left pinky~~
- ~~get back mouse navigation layer~~
- make all the keys transparent in the layers so you can still use tab, del, esc...
- Turn off the right and left thumb keys without caps which arent used.
- add the acute and grave accent symbols via alt-e , alt-n, alt-a
- ctrl+shift+v paste plain text
- add qwerty layer
- add GBP and EUR Symbol

Future: 

- wire the right side into the left controller,  and remove the right side controller. make new shield. test with the Elite C first.
